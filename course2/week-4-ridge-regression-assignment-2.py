# # Regression Week 4: Ridge Regression (gradient descent)

# In this notebook, you will implement ridge regression via gradient descent. You will:
# * Convert an SFrame into a Numpy array
# * Write a Numpy function to compute the derivative of the regression weights with respect to a single feature
# * Write gradient descent function to compute the regression weights given an initial weight vector, step size, tolerance, and L2 penalty

# # Fire up graphlab create

# Make sure you have the latest version of GraphLab Create (>= 1.7)

import graphlab


# # Load in house sales data
# 
# Dataset is from house sales in King County, the region where the city of Seattle, WA is located.

# In[2]:

sales = graphlab.SFrame('kc_house_data.gl/')


# If we want to do any "feature engineering" like creating new features or adjusting existing ones we should do this directly using the SFrames as seen in the first notebook of Week 2. For this notebook, however, we will work with the existing features.

# # Import useful functions from previous notebook

# As in Week 2, we convert the SFrame into a 2D Numpy array. Copy and paste `get_numpy_data()` from the second notebook of Week 2.

# In[3]:

import numpy as np # note this allows us to refer to numpy as np instead 


# In[4]:

def get_numpy_data(data_sframe, features, output):
    data_sframe['constant'] = 1
    features = ['constant'] + features
    features_sframe = data_sframe[features]
    feature_matrix = features_sframe.to_numpy()
    output_sarray = data_sframe[output]
    output_array = output_sarray.to_numpy()
    return(feature_matrix, output_array)


# Also, copy and paste the `predict_output()` function to compute the predictions for an entire matrix of features given the matrix and the weights:

# In[8]:

def predict_output(feature_matrix, weights):
    predictions = np.dot(feature_matrix, weights)
    return(predictions)


# # Computing the Derivative

# We are now going to move to computing the derivative of the regression cost function. Recall that the cost function is the sum over the data points of the squared difference between an observed output and a predicted output, plus the L2 penalty term.
# ```
# Cost(w)
# = SUM[ (prediction - output)^2 ]
# + l2_penalty*(w[0]^2 + w[1]^2 + ... + w[k]^2).
# ```
# 
# Since the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives, we can take the derivative of the first part (the RSS) as we did in the notebook for the unregularized case in Week 2 and add the derivative of the regularization part.  As we saw, the derivative of the RSS with respect to `w[i]` can be written as: 
# ```
# 2*SUM[ error*[feature_i] ].
# ```
# The derivative of the regularization term with respect to `w[i]` is:
# ```
# 2*l2_penalty*w[i].
# ```
# Summing both, we get
# ```
# 2*SUM[ error*[feature_i] ] + 2*l2_penalty*w[i].
# ```
# That is, the derivative for the weight for feature i is the sum (over data points) of 2 times the product of the error and the feature itself, plus `2*l2_penalty*w[i]`. 
# 
# **We will not regularize the constant.**  Thus, in the case of the constant, the derivative is just twice the sum of the errors (without the `2*l2_penalty*w[0]` term).
# 
# Recall that twice the sum of the product of two vectors is just twice the dot product of the two vectors. Therefore the derivative for the weight for feature_i is just two times the dot product between the values of feature_i and the current errors, plus `2*l2_penalty*w[i]`.
# 
# With this in mind complete the following derivative function which computes the derivative of the weight given the value of the feature (over all data points) and the errors (over all data points).  To decide when to we are dealing with the constant (so we don't regularize it) we added the extra parameter to the call `feature_is_constant` which you should set to `True` when computing the derivative of the constant and `False` otherwise.

# In[6]:

def feature_derivative_ridge(errors, feature, weight, l2_penalty, feature_is_constant):
    # If feature_is_constant is True, derivative is twice the dot product of errors and feature
    if(feature_is_constant):
        derivative = 2*np.dot(errors, feature)
    # Otherwise, derivative is twice the dot product plus 2*l2_penalty*weight
    else:
        derivative = 2*np.dot(errors, feature) + 2*l2_penalty*weight
    return derivative


# To test your feature derivartive run the following:

# In[9]:

(example_features, example_output) = get_numpy_data(sales, ['sqft_living'], 'price') 
my_weights = np.array([1., 10.])
test_predictions = predict_output(example_features, my_weights) 
errors = test_predictions - example_output # prediction errors

# next two lines should print the same values
print feature_derivative_ridge(errors, example_features[:,1], my_weights[1], 1, False)
print np.sum(errors*example_features[:,1])*2+20.
print ''

# next two lines should print the same values
print feature_derivative_ridge(errors, example_features[:,0], my_weights[0], 1, True)
print np.sum(errors)*2.


# # Gradient Descent

# Now we will write a function that performs a gradient descent. The basic premise is simple. Given a starting point we update the current weights by moving in the negative gradient direction. Recall that the gradient is the direction of *increase* and therefore the negative gradient is the direction of *decrease* and we're trying to *minimize* a cost function. 
# 
# The amount by which we move in the negative gradient *direction*  is called the 'step size'. We stop when we are 'sufficiently close' to the optimum. Unlike in Week 2, this time we will set a **maximum number of iterations** and take gradient steps until we reach this maximum number. If no maximum number is supplied, the maximum should be set 100 by default. (Use default parameter values in Python.)
# 
# With this in mind, complete the following gradient descent function below using your derivative function above. For each step in the gradient descent, we update the weight for each feature before computing our stopping criteria.

# In[11]:

def ridge_regression_gradient_descent(feature_matrix, output, initial_weights, step_size, l2_penalty, max_iterations=100):
    weights = np.array(initial_weights) # make sure it's a numpy array
    for it in range(max_iterations):
    #while not reached maximum number of iterations:
        # compute the predictions based on feature_matrix and weights using your predict_output() function
        predictions = predict_output(feature_matrix, weights)
        # compute the errors as predictions - output
        errors = predictions - output
        for i in xrange(len(weights)): # loop over each weight
            # Recall that feature_matrix[:,i] is the feature column associated with weights[i]
            # compute the derivative for weight[i].
            #(Remember: when i=0, you are computing the derivative of the constant!)
            if(i == 0):
                derivative = feature_derivative_ridge(errors, feature_matrix[:,i], weights[i], l2_penalty, True)
            else:
                derivative = feature_derivative_ridge(errors, feature_matrix[:,i], weights[i], l2_penalty, False)
            # subtract the step size times the derivative from the current weight
            weights[i] -= step_size * derivative
    return weights


# # Visualizing effect of L2 penalty

# The L2 penalty gets its name because it causes weights to have small L2 norms than otherwise. Let's see how large weights get penalized. Let us consider a simple model with 1 feature:
